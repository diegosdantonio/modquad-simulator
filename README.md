# ModQuad and Crazyflie Simulator

### Requirements
* Install crazyflie_ros: https://github.com/whoenig/crazyflie_ros
* install python packages `$ sudo pip install --upgrade numpy scipy transforms3d`



### Launching the simulator
The simulator for five quadrotors is launched by
```
$ roslaunch modquad_simulator simulation.launch
```
This launch file creates a module `modquad_sim` for each robot. This module simulates the dynamics of a quadrotor and displays its pose in RViz.
The launch file `simulation.launch` can be easily modified to change the number of quadrotors, their initial location and their color. Note that every new robot needs to be added in RViz too.

As well as the actual crazyflie robot, the simulated quadrotor receives two inputs:
* Attitude command: the topic _cmd_vel_ receives the desired thrust, roll, pitch and yaw inputs. It follows the same format as the `crazyflie_ros `package.
* Goal: using the `crazyflie_controller` package, the simulator also receives goals through the _goal_ topic. This package also includes the services for taking off and landing (see the documentation of the package). 

### Demo
Once the simulator is running, we can send desired goals to the robots.  The following script runs a demo that 
takes off the robots and makes them move in a circle.
```
rosrun demo-simulator demo_circle_multiple.py
```
